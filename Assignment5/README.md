# CPSC 319: Assignment 5 | Hash Tables 

**By: Sadia Khandaker**

This Java program creates a hash table that stores words from an input file so that the the resulting table is at least 70% full. The implemented hash function provides at least 50% hash efficiency. In addition, this program calculates and prints statistics about the average number of reads per record, the load factor, the hashing efficiency, and the size of the longest chain when searching.

# Compilation and Execution

The inputA5.txt file needs to be in placed in the working directory.

First, compile the program by running:

```
javac Assign5.java
```

Then, execute the program by running:

```
java Assign5 inputA5.txt output1.txt
```

The output1.txt file will be located in the working directory if the program is compiled and executed correctly.

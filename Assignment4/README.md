# CPSC 319: Assignment 4 | Graphs

#### By: Sadia Khandaker
This Java program reads the input and query files and imports their values into the Graph structure to perform depth-first and breadth-first graph traversal, respectively, then prints their paths to output1.txt and output2.txt files

# Compilation and Execution
The input.txt file and query.txt file need to be in placed in your working directory.

First, compile the program by running:
```
javac Assign4.java
```
Then, execute the program by running:
```
java Assign4 input.txt query.txt output1.txt output2.txt
```
The output1.txt file and output2.txt file will be located in the working directory if the program is compiled and executed correctly.
